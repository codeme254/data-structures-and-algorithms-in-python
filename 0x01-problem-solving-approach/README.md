**Algorithm** - a process or a set of steps to accomplish a certain task

Almost everything we do in programming involves some kind of algorithm and it's the foundation of being a successful problem solver and developer.

## How do you improve
- **Devise** a plan for solving problems.
- **Master** common problem solving patterns.

## Problem solving strategies
- Understand the problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look back and refactor

### _Understand the problem_
1. Can you restate the problem in your own words?
1. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
1. What are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
1. Can the outputs be determined from the input?
1. How should you label important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

### _Explore concrete examples_
- Coming up with examples help you to better understand the problem.
- They also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should.
1. Start with simple examples - with input and output - 2 to 3 examples.
1. Progress to more complex examples.
1. Explore examples with empty inputs - edge cases.
1. Explore examples with invalid inputs - edge cases

### _Break it down_
1. Explicitly write down the steps you need to take, it forces you to think about your code before you actually write it and helps you capture lingering issues or misunderstandings.

### _Solve/Simplify_
1. Solve the problem, if you can't, solve a simpler problem - try to ignore the part that is giving you a hard time in order to focus on everything else.
1. Find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do.
1. Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
1. Write a simplified solution.
1. The incorporate that difficulty back in.

### _Look back and refactor_
1. You have solved it, good, but you are not done.

1. Can you check the result?
1. Can you derive the result differently?
1. Can you understand it at a glance?
1. Can you use the result or the method for some other problem?
1. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
1. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
1. How have other people solved this problem?
